# ML-Algorithms-Hub

A comprehensive collection of **Machine Learning algorithms**, showcasing implementations in Python for **supervised**, **unsupervised**, and **reinforcement learning** techniques. This repository is designed for anyone looking to learn, experiment, or reference core machine learning concepts.

---

## Features
- **Supervised Learning**
  - Regression Algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Polynomial Regression)
  - Classification Algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN)
- **Unsupervised Learning** *(coming soon!)*
  - Clustering (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN)
  - Dimensionality Reduction (e.g., PCA)
- **Reinforcement Learning** *(planned!)*
  - Value-Based Methods (e.g., Q-Learning)
  - Policy-Based Methods (e.g., DDPG)

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/philippogol/ML-From-Regression-to-Reinforcement.git
   cd From-Regression-to-Reinforcement
   ```

2. **Virtual Environment Setup:**
   - Create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Required Libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run Examples:**
   - Navigate to the desired folder or script and execute:
     ```bash
     python3 regression/linear_regression.py
     python3 regression/support_vector_regression.py
     python3 regression/polynomial_regression.py
     ```
